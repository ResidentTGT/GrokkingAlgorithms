                    In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or
                    binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
                    Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal,
                    the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining
                    half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the
                    target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in
                    the array.

                    In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2)
                    time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the
                    similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages
                    over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is
                    limited. The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is
                    built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted
                    items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted
                    sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest,
                    depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the
                    leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one
                    element to the right.
